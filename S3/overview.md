from the Syllabus: 


S3 Maths Topics 

ARITHMETICS - Operations 
Roots: Understand and use the square root of a number / Use a calculator to find approximations of square roots
Powers: Understand and use powers a negative base  (Pico / Nano / Micro, Mega, Peta) 
Scientific Notation : Understand and use the scientific notation 
Order of operations: apply order of operations rules (incl. roots) 
Inverse : understand additive inverse and multiplicatve inverse of a number 
Percentage and ratios : Calculate a percentage of a number, a percentage increase and decrease; Use the relationship between percentages and ratios to solve problems


ALGEBRA: 

Functions

Linear functions: 𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏

Identify linear functions: Start to use the notation 𝑥 → 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏Graphs of linear functions 
In situations interpret gradients and intercepts of graphs of linear functions graphically

Direct and inverse proportion
Solve problems involving direct and inverse proportion, including graphical and algebraic representations


Expressions: 

Understand the difference between an expression, an equation and a formula

Understand when and how algebraic expressions can be manipulated to maintain equivalence by combining like terms, by expanding and simplify
a bracket expression such as 𝑎(𝑏 + 𝑐) and (𝑎 + 𝑏)(𝑐 + 𝑑) and factorise 𝑎𝑏 + 𝑎𝑐

Expand and factorise

Use these to calculate examples such as: 
1032 = (100 + 3)2
992 = (100 − 1)2

(𝑎 + 𝑏)(𝑎 − 𝑏) = 𝑎² − 𝑏²

51 × 49 = (50 + 1)(50 − 1)


Simplify expressions containing
brackets, fractions and combinations
of both


Solve linear equations up to the form
𝑎(𝑏𝑥 ± 𝑐) = 𝑑(𝑒𝑥 ± 𝑓) where
𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, 𝑒, 𝑓 and 𝑥 (unknown) are
rational numbers.
